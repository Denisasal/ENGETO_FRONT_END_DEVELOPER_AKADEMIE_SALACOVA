              Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are
              scattered all over this planet; you just need to know where to
              find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and
              the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over
              them. We’re proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of
              our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the
              route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey
              itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big
              climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and
              iconic treks you’ll love, too.

                  She has booked two major European trips for us in the past
                  year and every aspect has met, and in most cases exceeded, our
                  expectations. Best prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and
                  best cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is
                  she remembers the little things that we would do if we were
                  making the plans ourselves.

                  Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about
                  20 years and there is no one else I would trust to arrange my
                  trips and tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the group
                  trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day
                  cruise out of Venice and diving. It's always an eclectic group
                  of well traveled, interesting people.
